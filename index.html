            <h2>ABOUT ME</h2>
            <hr>
            <p> I am a versatile professional with a strong background in brand
                management, content creation, and research. As an Executive
                Brand Manager, I have enhanced market presence
                through strategic branding. With over 200 articles written across
                various niches, my experience as a Freelance Content Writer is
                extensive. My role as an Executive Research Analyst sharpened my analytical skills. I have also contributed as a
                ghostwriter and tutored primary students. My International
                Relations background provides a unique global perspective. Fluent
                in multiple languages, I excel in communication, adaptability, and
                problem-solving.</p>
